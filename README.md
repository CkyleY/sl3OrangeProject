Orange - Comparison of Analog and Digital Filters in Denoising Electrocardiogram Signals
Description: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart by placing electrodes on the skin to detect signals generated by the heart as it beats. It is an important diagnostic tool used by healthcare professionals to evaluate the heart's health and function and can help detect a wide range of heart conditions. For this reason, the presence of noise within this signal could prove detrimental in medical check up. This project aims to create the following features: 
      1. Utilize a number of analog and digital filters, 
      2. Determine the differences of the two filter types,
      3. Discover the most effective filter for denoising ECG signals.
